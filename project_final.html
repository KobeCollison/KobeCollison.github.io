          <h3>Two Finals in One</h3>
          <p>
            For my advanced geometry class, our final project is to imagine a world that applies by a different geometry to ours. We would also have to fabricate a model of some aspect
            or artifact of the world. Because there was so much overlap with this and my digifab final. The professors allowed me do both projects in one, A model of a world with 
            a unique geometry, with a model fabricated using multiple digital fabrication methods.

          <h3>Artifact: The Hedron</h3>
          <p>
              as explained <a href="final_geo.html">here</a>, my fabrication is to create a model of the rollercoaster, The Hedron
              The Hedron is a rollercoaster that takes advantage of the fact that it is inside of a 3-manifold, in this
              case being a Cube with each opposite side connected so that passing through one will result in comming out 
              other. We will be using Acrylic and wood to make the box that contains the ride, Along with 3D printed rails
              (FDM Printer) to represent the tracks with signs and other decorations like the cart made with laser cutting
              and more 3D printing. Finally, to the tracks would have a porgrammed LED light strip accross them to represent
              the cart's movement.

                The first prototype was a small 3D printed model of what the ride should look like. The real thing will
                be about 8 inches<sup>3</sup>. There are only edges and no walls on this because walls of the real thing 
                will be made of clear acrylic.

                The second prototype was a lot closer to the final product. We used wood for the walls instead of acrylic, so we 
                left the top open to see then inside through, the tracks printed at this time were a lot simpler than what we were
                planning to use in the final thing, but would suffice for now. And at this time, I was still working on the board 
                to control the lights.

      <p> The first part was designing the cirtcuit in a program called ciCad, which I honestly have no idea how to do at the
          moment, so I had the help of someone who works at the lab, who helped me through a large amount of this entire project
      </p>

      <p>I used a machine to cut out the copper circuitry.    </p>

      <p>Then I used solder to attach the pins, button, capacitor, resister and controller. The solder was a liquid paste at first, but after being heated by a heat gun,
        it cooled into a solid form, attaching the components.

        Then comes programming the chip in ardruino. The idea is that when the button is pressed, a light travels throughout all 
        of the neopixels 1 at a time to represent the cart moving throughout the track. I added a few extra things though. For one,
        every time the button is pressed the cart has a random color.

      <p>
        Also, we measured how many neopixels there were on each strip so I could color the lights at the end of each strip to
        symbolize where the cart would jump to next after reaching the end of one strip.
