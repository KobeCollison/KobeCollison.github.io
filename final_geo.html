            <h3>Coming Soon: The Hedron, The First Manifold Rollercoaster </h3>
            <p>
              We all know of the miricals of Geometric Spatial Gluing, or GSG for short. The technology that links separate spaces together as one and allows
              us to rewrite the laws of physics. Being the greatest advancement of the 24th century, GSG technology has revolutionized many fields from architecure to transportaion. Geoland has finally 
              released it's newest attraction, The Hedron, which uses GSG technology to transform the experience of a rollercoaster.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p> 
            The Hedron Takes place in what is known as a manifold, a mostly enclosed with walls that have been spatially glued. The border of the 
            Hedron is a simple manifold. A cube that glues tangent walls together while simultaneously glueing the top and bottom. The ride can support
            itself under these conditions thanks to the tracks being made of Mobius metal, which is immune to GSG's spatial manipulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The riders of the Hedron will spend the entire ride inside a space of 100 cubic feet. To the rider however, the Hedron feels like the largest 
            rollercoaster in the world. Being "confined" to a manifold gives the ride seemingly infinite possibilities for the path the riders take.

          <h3> A word from Dhomas Toyle, thoughts on the Hedron and the future of manifold rollercoasters </h3>
          <h6> Dhomas Toyle is a leading researcher in applying GSG technology to architecture, and seems to be
            very excited about what the Hedron could mean for the future of amusemtnt park rides
          </h6>
          <p>
            "
            There have been other attractions that have used some level of spatial gluing in certain areas, 
            but the Hedron is the first roller coaster to ever encase the full ride in a manifold. The Hedron 
            is currently not a very long ride because of it’s experimental nature, but it shows off the limitless 
            potential GSG technology could have for other rides. Why travel a great distance upward just to drop
             downward half the distance for speed. Instead, a ride with GSG plating could have the top and bottom 
             of it’s border glued, meaning that the cart could travel downward from any point in the ride with no 
             elevation, keep going down as long as it wants to, building speed after each time it reappears at the
              top  What if some sides are glued with a quarter rotation, changing the rider’s perspective when crossing 
              into a new side. Imagine what could happen if the cart travels through an edge or corner of the manifold. 
              (actually don’t imagine that. This might be a potentially disastrous safety concern.). The manifold could 
              even be constructed using different polyhedra in the future. There could be quite the experience had from
               just traveling in a straight line on a dodecahedron with a ⅕ rotation and ending up on different sides each
                time. GSG technology has opened doors no one even thought existed.
