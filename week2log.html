              <img src="images/Cutter.jpg" width="300" alt="github logo">
              <p style="clear: right;"> of course it is. why wouldn't it be? To my knowledge, digital is the combination
                of computer aided design and a physical medium for computer aided manufacturing. vinyl cutting is this exactly.
                I definetely did zero of the work I did in illustrator by hand, nor could I. and the vinyl cutter in a way, carves 
                out the desired shape from the sheet used. At least by my definintion, vinyl cutting is absolutely digital fabrication.

              <h3>Raster vs Vector images</h3>
              <img src="images/raster_v_vector.png" width="300" alt="image" >
              <p style="clear: right;" > Bitmap, or raster images, are images that rely on the pixels of the image being in certain locations. This is
                what most image formats like jpg, png, etc use. Raster images are better for high quality pictures but not good at resizing without losing detail, specifically when enlarging.
                vector images are more line based. They used math and formulas to determine how details of an image will form. Adobe illustrator mainly uses vectors.
                Vector images are better for simpler line art and logos, as they can be infinitely resized without losing any detail. However, vectors are not the best at
                complex pictures. For the sake of this project, since vinyl cutting is mainly used for simpler graphics, we want to be working with vectors.

      <p style="clear: right;"> The assignment was to design and apply a vinyl graphic to a piece of 
        clothing via the heat press. There had to be a quote of more than 15 characters. The shirt also
        needed  at least one graphic related to the quote. Minimum size of graphic is 4" x 4". Finally, we
        needed a photo of us wearing our finished product. I went with a shirt.

                    Thinking of what I wanted on my shirt was probably the longest part of this process.
                    I would say the time was wasted, but this was mainly just time I was spending doing other things
                    thinking about what my shirt could be. eventually I chose a graphic of a scene from one of my favorite 
                    movies, <i>Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse.</i>

                <h3>The Leap of Faith, why I chose this scene</h3>
                <img src="images/spiderverse_expectations.jpg"  alt="github logo">
                <p>
                   Throughout the movie, the main character, Miles Morales, struggles to find his way and do things that he 
                   wants to do while also living up to the expectations of others. These include the expectations of his parents and teachers
                   to succeed and school and become their version of a well off adult, as well as
                   the social expectations of his peers at his new school in which he feels an outcast
                </p>
            </div>
            <p> The burden of these expectations become extremly heavy after Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and is gifted with 
                spider powers just like Peter Parker. Peter Parker is soon killed by the main villain, so now Miles's must take on the mantle
                of spider-man and all of the <i>expectations</i> that come with it. the villain opens a rift in the multiverse, bringing other 
                versions of spider-man from different universes who plan to stop kingpin as well
            </p>
            <p>everyone else have been superheroes for years, in stark contrast
                with Miles, who only just got his powers, this causes him to doubt himself.
                In the end, Miles asks an older Peter Parker from a different universe how he will know
                whenever he is ready to be a true hero. The only answer that peter can give, is "You won't. It's a leap of faith. That's all it is, Miles. A leap of faith."
            </p>
            <img alt="screenshot" src="images/spider-verse-leap-of-faith.jpg">
            <p>
                This picture is of Miles makking a literal leap of faith, to see if he can use his powers
                to swing through the city, like spider-man, to help his friends. At this point, Miles believes
                in himself that he can be who he has to be, his way. Taking the spider-man suit and spray painting 
                it in his own style. This scene also has cool visual symbolism.  Miles is falling down to the ground 
                but the camera is flipped upside down, so as the director says, "Miles isn't falling through frame. He's RISING."
                Miles is able to put his powers to full use and help save New York as the new spider-man.

                <p>
                    Luckily, this was not my first time in illustrator. I used that scene and traced the buildings
                    and Miles falling using the pen tool, then imported the graffiti spider-man logo and 
                    the comic text bubble style quote block to use in my design. I really liked how everything
                    turned out.

                    I remember vinyl cutting going so smoothly during training. Oh how not smoothly it did not go for
                    me today. My shirt was XL, so the graphic needed to be larger as well. Little did I realise that the width
                    of my graphic was actually wider than the vinyl I was trying to cut it from. It might have been okay if the design still
                    came out but with a part missing, but instead, the machine got caught on the vinyl, crumpling the sheet and ruining the 
                    design THREE TIMES IN A ROW! twice before I found out what was going on and tried to resize it, and a third time when 
                    apprently I did not shrink the image enough.  Sadly, I was in too much of a panic watching the machine destroy my vinyl sheets to take a picture of it, but
                     I still have two of the failed sheets on me, sadly I through out one of the failure before I could take a picture.

            </div>
            <p> eventually, I was able to cut my graphic out properly, after that, it was time to do weeding, 99.9% of my weeding went well except for a bit in the top-right corner
                which I kind of had to wing by cutting bits off. I'm still very satisfied in the end.

                    Honestly, I forgot to take any pictures of the heating press problems. This part was pretty uneventful for me thoug.
                    No issues, this time. I didn't touch the top, burn and die so there isn't anything too exciting I can say about the 
                    heating press process, it worked, and it worked great, and I did not die...

              <p>
                  So after all the work, ups and downs, the shirt was finally printed. I was very happy with the way my design looked on the shirt, it is a design
                  I would very much wear. Though if I were to go back and change things (which I very much want to do), I would see if I could get a black T-shirt to
                  print the desing on. Also it turns out XL might have been a bit big and large should be enough. In the future, I want to redo this design on a black
                  T-shirt, with the graphic higher up, and the graphic of the graffiti spider-man logo large on the back. This project was incredibly cool and fun.
