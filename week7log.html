              <h3>A Different Type of 3D Printing</h3>
              <img src="images/SLA/sla_example.png" width="300" alt="image">
              <p style="clear: right;">SLA printing extrudes a solid filament and lays it out for it to resolidify. SLA printing works a bit
                differently. SLA Printing uses a liquid resin and points a laser at a specific part to solidify it. Although more expensive, this 
                process allows for much more precise prints.

            <h3>The Spinning Ring</h3>
            <p>The spinning ring was definetly the design that seemed the coolest to me. It was something that you could mess with when bored.
              The guide on how to make the spinning ring was very fast paced. This was, at times, both a good and a bad thing. The speed helped 
              me finish speed through parts that were obvious, but there were also many times when I had to go back to look at something because the 
              video was going too fast for me to pick up what happened the first time.

          1. The first part of this process was deciding how big of the ring should be. At the time, I didn't have enough time to
          measure my own finger, so I just went with something a little bit smaller than the tutorial ring, that being a 20mm diameter.

          2. Next was creating the cross section of the ring. this was the most important part of the spinning ring and the part that 
          had me looking back in the video repeatedly.

            3. To turn this cross section into a ring, I used the <b>revolve</b> tool at 360 degrees.

            4. I Then used <b>fillet</b> to curve the edges. I also needed the edges on the inside of the ring to be curved. The way this was accomplished was by
            using <b>section analysis</b> to target the edges on the inside.

            5. After the overall shape was complete, I had to add the text to it. I used <b>embosss</b> to attach text to the ring. The size of the text
            box was found using a <b>tangent plane</b> to the ring two names to names to the ring; Collison and Braithewaite, the last names on both my 
            father and mother's side.
