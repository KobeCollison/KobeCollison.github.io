      <p style="clear: right;">Normally, building a website would problably be considered one of the harder projects
        to be assigned in a class like this because not many students taking this class are expected to have a backgroud in web design. However, I have actually taken 
        multiple web desing classes in the past. One of which at high school and one being comp161 taught by
        professor Gousie. As a result, I am already proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
        very easily.

          <img src="images/HTML_icon.png" alt="github logo">
          <p style="clear: right;">These are two of the main tools used in building websites, HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is a language used to make
            the structure and content of websites. Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is used to style the html elements so the content looks appealing to the eye.
            Javascript is used to add extra functionality to the site using scripts.

          <h3>What is Git?</h3>
          <img src="images/github_logo.png" alt="github logo">
          <p style="clear: right;">Git is a tool used for managing projects with multiple files, often used by programmmers. A project is contained in 
            something called a repository, to access that repository from your computer, you can clone it to make a copy of it where you need it. from then 
            on, when there are changes made to the files in the repository, you can update those changes on your end as well by using pull, or if you have your own
            changes to make, you can send them using push.

                <h3>Setting up github pages</h3>
                <p>
                    I have used  once for a project last year, but sucked at it, and that involved using the desktop app, 
                    not the terminal. When I saw the setup proceess for github pages, I was worried about the difficulty of it, but it
                    suprisingly went by easily
                </p>
            </div>
            <p> I was able to set everything up initially using the terminal, but eventually, i realised
                that I could use the things i already learned from using the github desktop app for this project

                <h3>Working with a template</h3>
                <img src="" alt="github logo">
                <p>
                   For all of my past projects for building websites, everything had to be done
                   entirely from scratch. This time, since I felt that wasn't a requirment and I 
                   wanted the site to have a nice feeling quickly, since there was more to this assingment
                   than just the desing of the site, I decided to try out a template from w3schools.
                   It was really helpful to have a strong image of what the site will end up looking like from
                   the start. often, i would spend an unnescary amount of time thinkig about what the site should look like.
                   A small drawback of using the template was that the code was not my own, so there were many different css classes
                   I had no idea how to utilize and i might have ended up doing some things in less than optimal ways.
