              <img src="images/FDM/explain_fdm/1.png" width="300" alt="image">
              <p style="clear: right;">Fused deposition modeling , or FDM, printing is based on filaments. The printer uses heat to melt and extrude the filament onto a tray
                as a layer of the design, starting from the bottom. The filament soldifies into the user's design.

          <h3>How PrusaSlicer works</h3>
          <img src="images/FDM/explain_fdm/PrusaSlicer-1.png" width="250" alt="image">
          <p style="clear: right;">PrusaSlicer is the program we use to interact with the Prusa FDM printers in the fab lab. 
            PrusaSlicer can take a 3d model, from a file type like stl, and generate instructions on how to 3d print that model
            in a Prusa 3d Printer after clicking "slice now". The instructions for the printer are saved as G-code, which the printer
            uses to actually print out a model.

          <h3>Designing in Fusion360</h3>
          <p style="clear: right;">Befor going to PrusaSlicer, I would have to design the pot I wanted to print in
            Fusion360.

          1. The first part of this process was making the base. I used two circles with dimensions matching that of my desk organizer
          and extruded the ring created a litle over .25 inches.

          2. I then used two polygons, one right above the base and the other 3.5 inches above the first,
            (my final design had 10 sides on each polygon), and used loft to create the body the containing part

           3. I used loft again, but this time with 2 circles, one an inch above the base, and the other at the top of the pot,
           and made it a cut, this is the hole in pot for actually holding things. The reason I used loft and not just extrude is 
           because the circles are different sizes and were almost different shapes.

            5. And with that, my design was ready to print. I rendered and then exported this as an STL file to
               move on to PrusaSlicer.

          <h3>First Attempt: failure</h3>
          <img src="images/FDM/failure/1.png"  alt="image">
          <p>
              About an hour after I had put my design to print, I recieved a text saying that my print has failed and that I should try again. I would use the info I could gather
              from the failed attempt to make my final design better than before.

              <p style="padding: 50px;">At first, I thought it was a fatal error in my design. I was for sure it would be that the base was going to be completely sunken in on itself. 
                When I got to the lab, I was told that my print happened to slide for some unkown reason and that glueing the print tray should help. The base was the 
                one and only thing that had printed. I went back to my room and observed how the base fit in my desk organizer. It fit almost perfectly,
                but I decieded to make the base of the final design a little wider and thicker.
